### Main Controls
- Press ‘2’ to rotate left.
- Press ‘4’ to rotate right.
### Extra Controls
- Press ‘1’ to rotate left twice.
- Press ‘5’ to rotate right twice.

### Development
- Syncing the music with the physical note blocks was the biggest challenge.
- The drum beat and chords are generated randomly on each playthough.
- I downloaded an asset called MidiPlayer to help with this project.
- I added lighting to the platforms and small visual effects to the notes.

### Further Improvements
- The sound doesn’t work for 2 of the chord-types. I created this project a while ago and it lacks documentation, so I found it quite difficult to debug. With more time I may be able to find the issue.
- The game could be made more interesting by using higher quality music samples. I also plan on adding further melodic and percussive elements to make it sound more like music.
- For a fully functional game, the game would need to recognize and show when you hit a note. Having a score and grades that show how well you are doing would also enhance the overall experience.
- Finally, it would be nice to use a more visually appealing skybox.
